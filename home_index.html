                <p>I am Yutian Yang from China. I'm a undergraduate student in California Baptist University.
                </p>
                <p>I'm a rational person. I read massive volume of books in philosophy in high school. Out of
                    beginner's curiosity, I have studied the thoughts of many philosophers, and have been awed by
                    the brilliance of their great reasoning. Kant's Deontology and Hegel's Absolute Spirit show
                    the value and charm of rational thinking and the enlightenment ideologies.
                </p>

            </section>
            <section class="code">
                <p>I like to think logically. When I think about things, I dive into sea of facts like a
                detective. I find out the details one by one, and then thread them together to find the final
                answer. Because of my love for logical thinking and ambition to keep pace with frontier
                technology, I am fascinated by computer science. When I am coding, lines of codes were
                automatically divided into packets by my mind, logical and clear, like traveling into a
                magical tunnel with millions of archives. I am very excited and looking forward to my future
                study to truly pursue the art of coding.

            <section class="music" >
                <p>I'm also a person sensitive to changes in emotion. When I was a child, maybe because my
                    expression was not mature, I always observed the expressions of others when I listened to
                    their speech and watched their facial expressions. In most cases, I got more information from
                    the expressions than from the words. When I perceive those rich emotions, I feel excited,
                    because they are interesting, and I keep observing. When I grow up, I will burst into tears
                    when I see the great works of art displayed in museums. Most essentially, as a player and a
                    sincere lover of classical music, I feel an electric current rushing in my blood vessels as I
                    listen to the music of a great composer. Immortal spirit never fades!
                </p>
                <p>Because of my sensibility, I can feel the joys and sorrows of music, understand the mood of
                    composers, and feel the charm of music. Therefore, I love violin. I love music.
                </p>
                <p>A friend once asked me, </p>
                <blockquote>"why do you like music?"</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"Music makes me happy."</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"But some music is sad?"</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"To feel sadness in it is a happy thing in itself."</blockquote>
                <p> That's what makes musical art great, the ability to evoke universal emotions and empathy.
                </p>
            </section>

            <!--TODO: talk about violin itself, difference from other instrumental, different concerts, ensemble experience.-->
            <section class="idea">
                <p>I enjoy making friends with students from different majors. By making different friends, I can
                    master more knowledge and skills and promote my further development in the future. Alone in a
                    foreign land, it is hard to avoid loneliness and homesickness. I look forward to meeting my
                    new friends, communicating with them and sharing their lives and stories to adjust myself and
                    bravely confront any challenges in the future.
                </p>
                <p>Ideally, I would like to work in a electronic technology industry in the future, because it is
                    one of the most closely connected frontier fields in the world, which interacts extensively
                    with daily life and plays a critical role in developing the welfare of human society. At the
                    same time, I hope to participate in an orchestra, play the violin, get to know a group of
                    friends who play music and enrich my life in my spare time. Classical music is an eternal art
                    field, I believe that combing the most cutting-edge electronic technology with the most
                    classical music art together, I will be able to rub out shining sparks.
